# Sierpinsky_triangle
This is an interactive Python application that generates and analyzes the Sierpinski Triangle, a famous fractal. The user can customize parameters such as the level of recursion, the side length of the triangle, and its color. The program dynamically updates both the visual representation and the mathematical calculations.

✨ Features
✅ Real-time interactive visualization of the Sierpinski Triangle
✅ Adjustable recursion levels (0-6) to explore fractal depth
✅ Side length selection (1-10 cm) for size customization
✅ Color selection to modify the triangle's appearance
✅ Mathematical calculations including:

Number of triangles
Area per triangle
Total area
Perimeter per triangle
Total perimeter
✅ Informational popup explaining the Sierpinski Triangle's properties
✅ Simple and user-friendly interface built with PyQt6 and Matplotlib
